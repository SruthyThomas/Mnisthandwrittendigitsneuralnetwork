#      MNIST Digits Classification with Simple Neural Network

This project is a simple implementation of a neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark dataset in the machine learning community, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a basic neural network can be trained to accurately classify these digits.

## Prerequisites
    Python 3.x
    Required libraries: numpy, matplotlib,tensorflow,keras
    Jupyter Notebook 

## Results
   After training the neural network, I got a testing accuracy of 98%.

## Acknowledgments
  This project is inspired by the MNIST dataset, a benchmark in the field of machine learning.
  Special thanks to the creators and maintainers of the MNIST dataset.
