#      MNIST Digits Classification with Simple Neural Network

This project is a simple implementation of a neural network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark dataset in the machine learning community, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a basic neural network can be trained to accurately classify these digits.
